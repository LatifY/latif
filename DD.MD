# Design Document (DD.MD)

## Project Overview
A minimalist personal portfolio website built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vue**, and **TailwindCSS**, showcasing achievements, projects, and educational background in **game development** and **web development**. The design emphasizes simplicity, elegance, and a glassmorphism aesthetic with limited color usage (black, white, and one accent color). A dark mode version will be available.

The website will be hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy public access and maintenance.

## Design Goals
- **Aesthetic**: Minimalist, clean, and balanced use of negative space.
- **Color Scheme**: Black, white, and one accent color (e.g., soft cyan or amber).
- **Typography**: Simple, readable sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Manrope).
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle transparency and blur effects for panels and cards.
- **Dark Mode**: Smooth toggle with preserved readability and depth.
- **Responsiveness**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Performance**: Lightweight, fast-loading assets.
